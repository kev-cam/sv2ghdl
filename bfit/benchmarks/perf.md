# Cross-engine performance

Simulation time in **seconds** for a spread of real circuit styles, run on every
engine on this box. Each cell is `time ×speedup`, where speedup = (serial Xyce
time) / (engine time) — so **×>1 is faster than our Xyce**, and Xyce is ×1.0 by
definition. The **+bfit** columns swap in portable Verilog-AMS macromodels where
bfit recognizes a pattern (today: the BJT CE stage and the MOSFET current
mirror), and pass the netlist through untouched otherwise. 🟢 marks an open
engine (ngspice or Xyce, including +bfit) that is the **fastest** in its row;
🔵 marks one that **beats both commercial engines** (QSPICE/LTspice) but isn't
the outright fastest. `N/A` = the engine can't run that model (see notes). All
same netlist, no per-engine edits.

bfit substitutes the **CE stages** in the BJT amp (tuned macromodel: ngspice
1.56→0.25, Xyce 3.36→0.45 — the fastest cell in its row) and the **current
mirrors** in the OTA and the op-amp. The mirror model is two-part (I→V / V→I)
with rail compliance and handles both polarities and fan-out: in the **2-stage
op-amp** it replaces an NMOS bias bank (one reference feeding the tail + the
2nd-stage sink) *and* a PMOS load mirror, cutting **ngspice 1.09→0.11 s (≈10×)**
while tracking the output to ~0.01% — the behavioral mirrors have no internal
pole, so the solver drops the forced fine timestep and strides. (Xyce barely
moves: it was already taking adaptive steps.) On the models with no pattern yet,
bfit passes the netlist through unchanged, so it never costs anything. ngspice wins the two
digital/oscillator circuits outright, the commercial engines win the tiny analog
ones (sub-0.1 s = process startup, not solve), and the **SIMetrix mixed-signal
model runs only in the Xyce+nvc stack**.

## Scaling wall — who survives?

Past a few hundred series high-gain stages a BJT cascade turns numerically stiff.
Short-transient capacity probe; wall seconds if it completed, `brk` if it aborted
(timestep → ~1e-19):

| Stages | QSPICE | LTspice | ngspice | Xyce | Xyce+bfit |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 300 | 8 s | 5 s | 3 s | 4 s | 3 s |
| 1000 | brk | 53 s | brk | 18 s | 17 s |
| 3000 | brk | brk | brk | 235 s | 236 s |

By 1000 stages QSPICE and ngspice abort; LTspice dies by 3000; **only Xyce
reaches 3000** — the robustness its framework cost buys.

## Notes

- **Speedup baseline.** `×N.M` = (serial Xyce time) / (this engine's time);
  Xyce = ×1.0. The +bfit columns use the same baseline, so they read directly
  against every other engine.
- **How bfit accelerates.** Where it recognizes a pattern it substitutes a
  portable Verilog-AMS macromodel and — because those models are smooth — drops
  the forced max timestep and coarsens output, letting the solver stride. On a
  deeper CE cascade the +bfit lead grows to ~21× on ngspice and ~7× on Xyce at
  30 stages, then erodes as the cascade stiffens. Patterns today: CE stage and
  the MOSFET current mirror — a two-part I→V (reference current → overdrive
  voltage across a sense resistor, normalized on the smallest device) / V→I
  (each output = size·overdrive, going resistive near the rail) model, so one
  reference fans out to many outputs as in op-amp mirror banks. Next: diff pair.
- **Methodology.** Each cell is engine simulation time, cross-environment launch
  excluded — Windows engines (QSPICE, LTspice) self-report "Total elapsed time";
  Linux engines (ngspice, Xyce) are inner wall-clock inside WSL, min of runs.
  Threadripper PRO 5955WX (16C/32T); Xyce serial `-O3`. Generators: `gen_models.py`
  (suite), `gen_amp.py` (cascade). Sub-0.1 s cells are startup-dominated.
- **SIMetrix = N/A.** SIMetrix *does* have a non-GUI mode, but it runs through a
  standalone `SIM` console binary and requires **network** licensing. The free
  **SIMPLIS/Elements 9.2** install here ships only the GUI `SIMetrix.exe` (engine
  in `SIMCore.dll`, no `SIM.exe`) under a node-locked Intro license, so headless
  runs are doubly unavailable — it would take a licensed SIMetrix Pro with
  network licensing. The mixed-signal row, however, *is* a SIMetrix
  design: `simetrix_cosim.pl` translates a SIMetrix `.net` (digital A-devices →
  VHDL, analog → Xyce) and runs it on the Xyce+nvc runtime. The real
  **SIMetrix flyback (`fly.net`, UC3844, 18 digital A-devices)** binds 7/7
  analog↔digital boundaries and converges in this stack — the timed row uses the
  lighter `a2d` round-trip; nothing else here runs either.
- **Xyce-MPI = N/A.** A fixed ~15 s Trilinos/MPI solver-init plus inter-rank
  communication exceeds these models' entire serial runtime. Across an np=2..16
  sweep the optimum rank count grows with size (np2→4→6) but never beats serial
  here (best ~3× slower); MPI earns its keep on large meshed designs and cloud
  scale-out. See `mpisweep.sh`.
- **N/A** also covers engines that rejected a netlist unmodified (QSPICE on the
  ring oscillator) — the same portable deck ran everywhere else.
